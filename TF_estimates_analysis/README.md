## TF estimates analysis

Subworkflow for analysing ctDNAmers TF estimates and comparison with clonal SNVs mean allele frequency. 

The subworkflow can be run from the same directory as ctDNAmers was run, as same samples and units files will be utilized from the config folder. 

In addition to TF estimates, user needs to provide clinical data information and intervention information to determine the ground truth of the samples, additionally imaging information for timeline plotting and WGS sequencing coverage information for comparison with the k-mer distributions mean and standard deviation.
